# The Project Aims to explore various domains of Co-operative Perception

## The scope of the project is limited currently to the following framework to be developed 

- A framework that measures the available bandwith and quality of bandwith avaialable to a local agent in a coperative perception scene
- A scene in Carla where at minimum two agents can record information 
- Visualization of available compute resources and states of local agents

(PS: a local agent term is used loosely here due to coperative perception and can be anything that can record state and transmit state of world around it )

## Environment and Setup

- The simulator used is Carla . Self built files are added to git ignore to save space on every distribution . Meanwhile the realease maybe used internally or linked here. 
- Python , jyupiter notebooks and a conda environment is used to self contain most dependancies 
- Unreal engine code is heavily used for modification and usage. C++ and blueprint basics are used in the project for ease of life when carla doesn't have direct functionality
