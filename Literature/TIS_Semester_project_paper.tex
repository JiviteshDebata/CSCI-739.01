\section{Introduction}

With the advent of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the ongoing development of autonomous vehicles, cooperative perception has emerged as a crucial aspect of vehicular communication. In order to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and situational awareness, vehicles must share their perception data with neighboring vehicles and infrastructure. Among the different types of sensor data, 3D point cloud data generated by LiDAR sensors is particularly important due to its high resolution and ability to accurately represent the surrounding environment [1].

However, the large amount of data generated by LiDAR sensors presents challenges for real-time transmission and processing, particularly in the context of vehicular networks with limited bandwidth and latency constraints. To address this issue, efficient 3D point cloud compression techniques are necessary to reduce the size of the data while maintaining a high level of reconstruction quality. Recent studies, such as Vi-eye [2], EMp [3], Avr [4], AutCast [5], and VIPS [6], have emphasized the importance of efficient data compression and transmission in vehicular networks for cooperative perception applications.

Given that most of these studies demonstrated the best-case scenarios using the CARLA simulator, it is essential to develop a more comprehensive measurement study that considers a wider range of factors that affect the performance of 3D point cloud compression techniques in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a measurement study that aims to provide a level playing field for the comparison of various compression techniques. Unlike previous works, we have extended the CARLA simulator to conduct our experiments qualitatively and quantitatively, as others in the field have come to realize the importance of a more realistic evaluation [7, 8].

Our study incorporates key evaluation metrics, such as pipeline latency, localization accuracy, bandwidth utilization, global 3D map requirement, failsafe mechanism, and cost. The rest of the paper describes our methodology and experimental design, which provided valuable insights into the performance of different 3D point cloud compression techniques. In the end, we present our evaluation showcasing the extensions we made to the CARLA simulator, as well as our results, and conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings and future research directions.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Explained to a 10 year old:}

In this section, we outline our methodology for evaluating different 3D point cloud compression techniques in the context of cooperative perception. We begin by defining the key evaluation metrics, including accuracy, robustness, available bandwidth and its usage, global 3D map requirement, network robustness, information transmission approach, failsafe mechanism, and cost. Following this, we dive deeper into the papers collected, analyzing their relevance and identifying the most pertinent aspects for our study.

2.1 Evaluation Metrics

2.1.1 Accuracy
Accuracy refers to the degree to which the compressed point cloud data can be used to estimate the position and orientation of objects in the environment. Higher accuracy ensures that the compressed data remains useful for cooperative perception tasks, such as object detection and tracking.

2.1.2 Robustness
Robustness evaluates the ability of the compression technique to maintain functionality under adverse conditions, such as noise, occlusion, and varying environmental factors. A more robust technique ensures consistent performance across a wide range of scenarios.

2.1.3 Available Bandwidth and Its Usage
Available bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over the vehicular network at a given time. The usage of available bandwidth measures the efficiency with which the compression technique utilizes the network resources for data transmission.

2.1.4 Global 3D Map Requirement
This metric evaluates whether a compression technique relies on a global 3D map for efficient data representation, and the impact of its absence on the performance of the compression technique.

2.1.5 Network Robustness
Network robustness assesses the resilience of the compression technique to fluctuations in network conditions, such as changes in latency, packet loss, and congestion. Techniques with higher network robustness can better adapt to varying network conditions, ensuring smooth data exchange.

2.1.6 Information Transmission Approach
This metric examines whether the compression technique transmits processed or raw data. Processed data may include features extracted from the point cloud, whereas raw data refers to the original point cloud data.

2.1.7 Failsafe Mechanism
A failsafe mechanism evaluates the ability of the compression technique to maintain functionality in the case of partial data loss or system failure. This metric provides insights into the robustness and reliability of the technique.

2.1.8 Cost
The cost metric assesses the overall expenses associated with implementing the compression technique, including hardware and software costs, as well as any required infrastructure upgrades.

\subsection{Current Literature:}

With the evaluation metrics defined, we proceed to analyze the collected papers, focusing on the relevance of their proposed techniques, the environments they were tested in, and the specific aspects of each technique that are most pertinent to our study. This analysis allows us to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each technique, and how they relate to the defined evaluation metrics.

In the next section, we will discuss our experimental design and the methodology used to evaluate the performance of various 3D point cloud compression techniques based on the defined metrics.


We collected and analyzed the following papers: AVR [1], Vi-eye [2], EMp [3], AutoCast [4], and VIPS [5]. Our analysis revealed discrepancies in standards and metrics across these studies, making it difficult to compare their performance directly.

For instance, localization accuracy was defined and measured differently in each paper, leading to variations in the reported results. Pipeline latency and bandwidth requirements also lacked a standardized method of measurement and reporting. Instead of answering the question, "how much bandwidth does it require to function properly?", the studies reported the network's scalability with varying numbers of vehicles or consumed packet numbers.

Our goal is to measure the performance of these compression techniques under different scenarios, such as when there is an excess of bandwidth or when the available bandwidth is limited. To achieve this, we developed a set of standardized evaluation metrics (as defined in Section 2.1) that would allow us to compare the techniques on a level playing field.

Table I \ref{tab:empirical_analysis} provides a visual representation of our analysis, highlighting the discrepancies in the standards across the collected papers.

In the next section, we will discuss our experimental design and the methodology used to evaluate the performance of various 3D point cloud compression techniques based on the defined metrics and the insights gained from our analysis of the collected papers.

\subsection{Experimental Design and Scenario Analysis}
In this section, we describe our experimental design and the methodology used to evaluate the performance of various 3D point cloud compression techniques based on the defined metrics and the insights gained from our analysis of the collected papers. Based on our analysis, VIPS [1] emerged as the clear winner, requiring minimum bandwidth and outperforming the other techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. However, our professor presented a challenging scenario that led us to explore two different paths in our experimental design.

3.1 Challenging Scenario

The scenario involved three vehicles: Vehicle A and Vehicle C, both equipped with LiDAR sensors and connected to the same vehicular network, and Vehicle B, a non-networked, dynamic agent. Vehicle A partially observes Vehicle B's point cloud, and Vehicle C also partially observes Vehicle B's point cloud. The objective is to determine the conditions under which Vehicle C should transmit its partial observation of Vehicle B to Vehicle A, and when Vehicle A should accept this additional data to improve its perception of Vehicle B.

3.2 Path 1: Qualitative Analysis and Exploration of New Topics

In this subsection, we explore the first path, which focuses on conducting a qualitative analysis using an Excel sheet to compare the numeric values of different compression techniques. During this process, we discovered non-standardization issues, which led us to identify the chicken-and-egg problem. We also investigated other domains that demonstrated partial point cloud to full feature recognition.

Moreover, we found limitations in the CARLA simulator and noticed that other researchers faced similar challenges. This discovery motivated us to develop our own experimental approach, which we detail in Path 2.

3.3 Path 2: Custom Implementation Using CARLA and Unreal Engine

In this subsection, we explore the second path, which focuses on creating a custom implementation to address the limitations of the CARLA simulator. CARLA uses the Unreal Engine as its base C++ simulator engine, with game loops running over a road network pre-annotated with ground truth information about various points. CARLA also has a ROS bridge PCL recorder that attempts to record point cloud data manually, but visual representation of the scene is difficult to achieve.

To overcome these limitations, we decided to develop a visual tool that integrates with the CARLA simulator and Unreal Engine. This tool would allow us to better visualize and analyze point cloud data and facilitate the evaluation of different compression techniques in the context of the challenging scenario.

By analyzing the two paths, we aim to identify the most suitable approach for handling the challenging scenario, providing valuable insights into the performance of 3D point cloud compression techniques in real-world situations with dynamic agents and limited network resources.


\subsection{Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis}
Based on our analysis, VIPS [1] emerges as the most suitable method to implement. However, the feedback we received raised concerns about the trustworthiness of processed data from another vehicle and the necessity of cooperative perception to solve scenarios where the combined point cloud information from two vehicles is needed to provide a complete picture.


To address these concerns, we explored the following papers to understand the potential risks and countermeasures associated with LiDAR-based perception in autonomous driving:

"Towards Robust LiDAR-based Perception in Autonomous Driving: General Black-box Adversarial Sensor Attack and Countermeasures" [2]
"Adversarial Sensor Attack on LiDAR-based Perception in Autonomous Driving" [3]
4.1 Important Inferences from the Papers

From these papers, we gathered important insights related to the potential risks and challenges associated with LiDAR-based perception in autonomous driving:

1.Adversarial sensor attacks pose a significant threat to the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, as they can manipulate the sensor readings and cause misperceptions, leading to unsafe or incorrect decisions.

2.Current LiDAR-based perception systems are vulnerable to both targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for robust countermeasures to ensure the safety and reliability of cooperative perception.

3.Possible countermeasures include improving the robustness of the perception algorithms, designing adversarial training methods, and implementing secure data transmission protocols to protect the integrity of the point cloud data exchanged between vehicles.

4.To establish trust in cooperative perception, it is essential to develop methods for verifying the authenticity and integrity of the processed data received from other vehicles.


By incorporating the insights from these papers, we can further refine our analysis and develop more robust and trustworthy 3D point cloud compression techniques that can effectively address the challenging scenario and ensure the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments.

\subsection{Extending Carla}
In this section, we discuss our efforts to extend the CARLA simulator to support our experimental design and address the challenging scenario involving vehicles A, B, and C. We focused on developing two main components: a Vehicle Manager and a Network Manager.

5.1 Vehicle Manager

Creating custom scenarios in CARLA can be quite challenging, especially when it comes to spawning and managing multiple vehicles. The CARLA documentation [1] provides a guide for spawning vehicles, but the process is complex and requires a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and architecture.

To facilitate the creation of the scenario involving vehicles A, B, and C, we aimed to develop a Vehicle Manager. This component would simplify the process of spawning and controlling vehicles within the simulation, allowing us to focus on the evaluation of 3D point cloud compression techniques and cooperative perception.

5.2 Network Manager

Another challenge we encountered was the lack of built-in support for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in CARLA. The simulator's documentation does not provide any guidance on implementing networking concepts for cooperative perception between vehicles.

To address this limitation, we aimed to develop a Network Manager that would enable communication between vehicles in the simulation. This component would allow vehicles to exchange point cloud data and other relevant information, simulating the real-world conditions of V2V communication for cooperative perception.

By extending CARLA with a Vehicle Manager and a Network Manager, we hope to create a more realistic and flexible simulation environment for evaluating the performance of 3D point cloud compression techniques in the context of cooperative perception. These extensions will enable us to investigate the challenging scenario involving vehicles A, B, and C and provide valuable insights into the real-world applicability of the evaluated compression techniques.

\section{Evaluation}
In this section, we present the evaluation of our extended CARLA simulator, focusing on the differences between the point cloud visualization and cooperative perception results obtained using our method and the original CARLA method. We compare the performance of the 3D point cloud compression techniques in the context of the challenging scenario involving vehicles A, B, and C.

6.1 Comparison of Point Cloud Visualization

We first compare the point cloud visualization generated by our extended CARLA simulator with that of the original CARLA method. This comparison helps us determine the effectiveness of our Vehicle Manager and Network Manager extensions in creating a more realistic and flexible simulation environment for cooperative perception.

We analyze the performance of the 3D point cloud compression techniques in the context of the challenging scenario involving vehicles A, B, and C, considering metrics such as pipeline latency, localization accuracy, bandwidth requirements, and robustness.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% \begin{itemize}
% % \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% % \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% % \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% % \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}


% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the 
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3. 

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
% ``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

% DOCUMENT NOTES:
% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
